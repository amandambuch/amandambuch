## Nice to meet you! üëã

### About Dr. Amanda Buch:

:brain: :gear:	I am a neuroscientist and machine learning engineer at Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, psychiatry, and international relations. 

‚ú® I am currently developing novel approaches for cluster-aware machine learning of neuroimaging, behavioral, and omic data :snowboarder:, and I am deploying them for AI-informed precision neuropsychiatry.

:gem: I am honored to be a [Ford Foundation Early-Career Fellow](https://ra.nas.edu/FordFellows20/ExtRpts/PressReleaseRoster.aspx?RptMode=AW&CompYr=2023), [Burroughs Wellcome Fund / Charles Revson Scholar](https://www.bwfund.org/news/announcing-the-recipients-of-the-2024-postdoctoral-diversity-enrichment-program/), and [Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Leading Edge Fellow](https://www.leadingedgesymposium.org/fellows/). :trophy:

:open_hands: I am also a science diplomat and communicator. For example, see my work [for AAAS Science & Diplomacy](https://www.aaas.org/news/emerging-technologies-role-science-diplomacy) and Story Collider[https://www.storycollider.org/stories/2016/12/2/amanda-buch-my-fathers-brain]. I have also presented at over 50 forums including conference presentations, invited seminars/lectures, and invited panelist speaking engagements in North America, Europe, and Asia.

:globe_with_meridians: ü§ù As a science diplomat, I facilitate community engagement between the international scientific community and the public. I also research and advocate for policy-wide changes to enhance international scientific collaboration, equity, and inclusion.
